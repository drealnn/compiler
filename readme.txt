To compile, run the following on the Eustis command line while 
the active directoy contains the .c files included in this zip:
gcc main.c scanner.c parser.c stack.c vector.c -o compiler

When running compiler, the arguments -l, -a, and -v will print
the lexeme list, assembly code, and/or vm stacktrace as indicated
in the documentation.

After running, the following text files will be generated in the same directory:
cleaninput.txt - Contains the original input minus any comments.
lexemelist.txt - Contains a list of lexeme tokens generated by the scanner.
lexemetable.txt - Contains the lexeme list in table form.
mcode.txt - Contains the generated assembly code.
